# Node JS WebStreams

WebStreams are a powerful of providing BIG data  through chunks of bytes.

## TDD

Test-Driven Development was great to implement routes whose data responses were too big to be brute-forced tested.

> Overall, TDD offers a more efficient and reliable approach to software development, ensuring that code is thoroughly tested before being integrated into the system

### Why has this project been released?

Because Streams relies on data sources such as Databases, binary objects or large CSV files (in real production scenarios), this raw implementation may be used across different use-cases!
